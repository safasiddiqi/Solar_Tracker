# Solar_Tracker

The objective of the project was to provide a cost effective solar distributed system, the system presents a low cost active dual axis solar tracking system using arduino, and to learn the relation of physical mechanics and electrical of real world with the virtual world of coding. The driving motors used here were the servo and stepper motors which usually consume less power, maximum of 9V, and also gives us the control over speed and position of the system. The idea of the solar tracker was that of a cost-effective and easy to built product.
